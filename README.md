## Index
### _a symlink-based virtual archiver for your media files._

Aim it at a folder with a ton of images from over the years, in however many subfolders they're in.
It'll run through, analyze them, and build an output directory with all your media files organized by type and date.
Each file in the index is a symlink, meaning you can instantly have an organized copy of your files with minimal additional disk usage, and without disturbing your original folder setup
