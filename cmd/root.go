 Index - A symlink-based virtual archiver for media files.

 Pass in a source directory and intended destination and, after a scan, an index will be created.
 Each file in the index is a symlink, meaning you can instantly have an organized copy of your files 
 with minimal additional disk usage, and without disturbing your original folder setup`,
